                           <p>It's been 6 years since Idler of the Wheel..(whose full title is a 23-word poem), Fiona Apple's fourth stuido album, but the singer-songwriter and pianist is 
                           still continuously writing, recording and performing songs left, right and center.</p>
                           
                           <p>Not surprising since she's been writing since her early teens, and released her debut album in 1996, Tidal, written when Apple was only 17.
                           The album earned her a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single "Criminal". </p>
                           
                           <p>She followed with When the Pawn... in 1999, her second studio album, which also became critically and commercially successful and 
                           earned her certified platinum. The 444-character, eight-line of stream-of-consciousness poem is one of the longest album titles ever.</p>
        
                           <p>Her third album Extraordinary Machine was released in 2005, was certified gold, and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal 
                           Album. </p>
                           
                           <p>In 2012, the release of The Idler Wheel...saw her receive critical praise and was followed by a tour of 
                           the United States.</p>
                           </div>
                            <p>With only four albums to her name in a 20-plus year career, The Grammy-winning singer-songwriter has clearly shown that she does not conform to 
                            expectations, and does what she pleases. Rather refreshing to say the least, when we live in an era when a day without an Instagram 
                            is considered radio silence. </p>
        
                            <p>But over the past few years, the normally reclusive singer has released a series of quirky one-offs that hint she is re-entering the 
                            game. Then again, it could just be Fiona being Fiona. </p>
                          
                           <p>Last February she released a slice of meditative chamber pop, "Left Handed Kisses," a duet with whistle-happy singer Andrew Bird. 
                            She then went off the radar for 10 months until she popped up on the list of artists for the We Rock with Standing Rock benefit 
                            in support of the members of the Standing Rock Sioux protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. It was at that group's December show 
                            that she unveiled her vicious takedown of soon-to-be-inaugurated President Donald Trump, "Trump's Nuts Roasting on an Open Fire."</p>
        
                           <p>She was not nearly done trolling the former Celebrity Apprentice host, though. In honor of January's Women's March, 
                            Apple made her feelings about Trump crystal clear with the biting original "Tiny Hands." The sliver of a song was dropped 
                            in advance of the massive protest that drew millions around the globe and featured the unforgettable refrain, 
                            "We don't want your tiny hands anywhere near our underpants."</p>
                            
                           <p>In 2018, she recorded a new song for the Carnegie Hall Lullaby Project’s latest Hopes and Dreams compilation. 
                            Titled “I Can’t Wait to Meet You,” written by Solange Jimenez and Thomas Cabaniss for the compilation, 
                            which pairs pregnant women and new mothers in hospitals, homeless shelters, schools, and prisons with professional 
                            musicians to record their music. Other artists featured on the compilation include Angélique Kidjo, Catherine Zeta-Jones, 
                            Rosanne Cash, Natalie Merchant, and more.</p>
        
                           <p>The project is done to support maternal health, aid child development, and foster a bond between mothers and children 
                            throughout New York City. Apple’s recording opens with a brief spoken word section by Jimenez before the bluesy songstress 
                            takes over. </p>
                            
                           <p>And if that didn't keep her busy enough, she joined Shirley Manson at the female-driven Girl School Festival in Los Angeles 
                            for a cover of "You Don't Own Me" by Lesley Gore, wearing a white T-shirt with "KNEEL, PORTNOW" written across it in ink. 
                            This was considered in response to Grammy head Neil Portnow's heavily criticized comments that women need to "step up" 
                            in order to earn more Grammy nods.
